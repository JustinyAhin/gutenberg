# Block navigation

The BlockNavigation component provides an overview of the hierarchical structure of all blocks in the editor. The blocks are presented vertically one below the other.

Blocks that have child blocks (such as group or column blocks) are presented with the parent at the top and the nested children below.

In addition to presenting the structure of the blocks in the editor, the BlockNavigation component lets users navigate to each block by clicking on its line in the hierarchy tree.
